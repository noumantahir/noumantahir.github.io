<br><br><b>AFRIKASA SOFTWARE TERMS</b><br>
In addition to these Conditions of Use, (including any updates or upgrades to the software and any related documentation) that we make available to you from time to time for your use in connection with AfrikasaServices (the "AfrikasaSoftware").
<br><br><b>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b><br>
THE AFRIKASA SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) AND OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE AFRIKASA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY AFRIKASA ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. AFRIKASA MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE AFRIKASA SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE AFRIKASA SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE AFRIKASA SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.<br><br>
TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, AFRIKASA DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. AFRIKASA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE AFRIKASA SERVICES, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE AFRIKASA SERVICES, AFRIKASA'S SERVERS OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM AFRIKASA ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. AFRIKASA WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF ANY AFRIKASA SERVICE, OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH ANY AFRIKASA SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.<br><br>
CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

<br><br><b>DISPUTES</b><br>
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Afrikasa Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Afrikasa or through Afrikasa.me will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.<br>
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.<br><br>
Afrikasa will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.<br>
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
<br><br><b>APPLICABLE LAW</b><br>
By using any Afrikasa Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Indiana, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Afrikasa
<br><br><b>SITE POLICIES, MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY</b><br>
Please review our other policies. These policies also govern your use of Afrikasa Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, Service Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.<br>
Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement<br>
If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please submit your complaint using our contact form. We respond quickly to the concerns of rights owners about any alleged infringement.<br>
If you prefer to submit a report in writing, please provide us with this information:<br>
A physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;<br>
A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed upon;<br>
A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the site;<br>

 <h2> Privacy Policy </h2>

 <p>Afrikasa Media is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information collected from you, what the APP does withÂ it, with whom it shares the information, and how you can correct or change such information. It is your responsibility to reviewÂ this Privacy Policy carefully, especially before providing any personal information (i.e., personally identifiable information) through this App. By using the Afrikasa Media App, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.
<br><br><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
This App does not collect personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be used to identify or contact you,Â such as your name, email address, or mailing address) from you unless you voluntarily choose to submit that information. IfÂ you provide personally identifiable information, that information will be used for the purposes for which you have provided it,Â and for other purposes that are consistent with this Privacy Policy, and permitted by law. This App does not shareÂ personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties except as permitted by law and for all other purposes that are consistent with this Privacy Policy. This App undertakesÂ reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information you provide.
<br><br><b>Use of your Personal Information</b><br>
Afrikasa Media collects and uses your personal information to operate Afrikasa Media Apps and deliver the services you have requested. Afrikasa Media also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Afrikasa Media and its affiliates. Afrikasa Media does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Afrikasa Media may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (such as your e-mail address, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Afrikasa Media may share data with trusted partners to help us send you e-mail or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Afrikasa Media, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.<br>
<br>Afrikasa Media may keep track of the Apps and pages our customers visit within Afrikasa Media in order to determine what Afrikasa Media services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Afrikasa Media to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. Afrikasa Media Apps will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Afrikasa Media or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Afrikasa Media; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Afrikasa Media, or the public.
<br><br><b>Security of your Personal Information</b><br>
Afrikasa Media secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Afrikasa Media secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Apps, it is protected through the use of encryption. The SSL is only active when customers log-in or start to register.
<br><br><b>Third Parties and Other Sites</b><br>
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are vendors or buyers on our sites or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you provide to them. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy.Â  When you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the site operatorâ€™s privacy policy, not the Afrikasa Mediaâ€™s Privacy Policy. We encourage you to read that policy before submitting any personal information.Â 
<br><br><b>Data Security Disclaimer</b><br>
While this App intends to safeguard your personal information, data transmission over theÂ Internet, including e-mail and postings, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, this App cannot ensure orÂ warrant the security of any information you transmit, and any information you transmit is done at your own risk. This AppÂ cannot be responsible for disclosures of your personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts ofÂ third parties, and encourages you to exercise prudence in selecting the information you send via the Internet, including via e-mail.
